# Welcome!
Hi there, my name is Jay and I'm a data scientist in Austin, TX. I'm passionate
about machine learning and use this site to share some of my projects. I currently run [Bayes Consulting](http://www.bayesconsulting.io), a machine learning consultancy based out of Austin. 

Before founding Bayes Consulting, I worked in a few research labs,
local startups, as well as big companies like Microsoft and McKinsey.
In 2014 I graduated from UT Austin with degrees in CS and Business where my
research focus was in collaborative filtering and recommendation engines.
