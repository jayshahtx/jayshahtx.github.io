Traffic theory might just be the darling of the data science research. Its universal relevance coupled with technical nature makes it a frequent topic of conversation in the technical community. If you were to distill these discussions into three simple theories on why traffic exists, you'd arrive at a list that looks something like this:<br><br>

**1. Demand for road usage exceeds capacity** (e.g., more cars on the road during rush hour than a road can handle)

**2. Human driving behavior creates inefficiencies** (e.g., a car that brakes hard will cause all the cars behind it to brake even harder)

**3. Design and construction of roads creates friction in the flow of traffic** (e.g., a traffic light that takes a long time to change)

The first two theories are easy to observe but difficult to address. They resonate well with anyone who's been stuck during their morning commute but require changing the behavior of millions of drivers. Because they are easy to identify with, most of the dialogue on traffic anchors on these two theories.

The third theory is opposite in nature; its difficult to observe without a system-wide view of traffic but has an actionable solution (improved road design).

In the sea of rich discussion, my thesis on traffic theory is simple - the best solutions to traffic are those that are easiest to execute. In this spirit, theory #3 will be the focus of this analysis.

## How to study traffic

Studying traffic requires a dataset that is difficult to curate: real vehicle data with speed, direction, and location over a significant period of time. While it would be challenging to get this data for personal/civilian cars, there is one type of vehicle that is often tracked publically: **public buses**. <br><br>

The Chicago Transit Authority has an open API which tracks each bus in real time, around the clock. Over the course of a month, I was able to collect 2.6M records of bus locations across 30 days and all 100+ bus routes. The raw data looks like this:

When we visualize a random subset of this data, we can see the distribution of buses across the city:

## Identifying traffic jams

Identifying a slow down or jam in traffic is a relative calculation - we only know that the flow of traffic has slowed because we understand how quickly it should be moving otherwise. Therefore to create a model of traffic, we must understand the speed at which traffic moves through the city at any specific location and at any specific time.

To create such a model, imagine dividing the city of Chicago into a large grid with thousands of cells the size of a city block; each cell could have its own profile of speed throughout the day. If we then highlight the cells in which vehicles are moving at below average speeds, we can create the following visualization:

The highlighted areas of traffic appear to make sense, flowing in and out of the city towards the beginning and end of each business day.

## Zeroing in on the source of traffic

The final piece of understanding where exacty traffic occurs is to study how traffic accumulates over time. Because traffic behaves recursively, a slow down at a specific location will create another slow down just before it (and so on, and so forth).

A good example of this behavior is along the famouse Lake Shore Blvd (subset of US-41). The visualization below shows the buildup of Northbound traffic in the mornings. Red indicates areas where traffic is flowing at less than half of the observed speed limit.

You may notice that traffic originates from two points in particular throughout the morning. Let's take a look at each of these locations to try and identify what's causing the traffic.

Point A represents the first opportunity to enter the city from Lake Shore Blvd. Up until this intersection, traffic has been flowing across 5 lanes at 40-50 mphs with only a few traffic lights in the preceeding several miles. However, only two of the five lanes actually go into the city. In addition to the reduction in number of lanes, a traffic light further restricts the flow of cars. Given that a substantial percentage of commuters on Lake Shore are headed downtown, its not difficult to see why this particular intersection could be a bottleneck.

Lake Shore and Waldron is not a particulary exciting intersection. Just south of the Soldier's stadium, the only notable attribute of this intersection is that it is marked by a traffic light. Given that this is the first Northbound traffic light in several miles, its existence alone likely contributes to congestion. 

## Solving traffic

It's difficult to imagine a world without traffic, even with autonomous cars. While it certainly should be the aspiration, I'm not yet convined it will be our reality. However the path to realizing this aspiration should be one of structural, systemic, solutions - not behavioral.

Engineers and academics have tried time after time to influence driver behavior unsuccessfully. Commuter tax, promotion of carshare, and attempts to influence driving styles have all fallen short of addressing the problem.

Analyses like these, while are brief, show that there are clear ways to uncover friction in traffic and potential paths to improve the overall traffic grid.
