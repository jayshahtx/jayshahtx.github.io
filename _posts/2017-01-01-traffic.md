People tend to talk a lot about traffic - no one is immune to it and everyone has a theory on why it exists. So why can't we figure out how to deal with it? The answer, as it often is, is that it's complicated. When we take a look at traffic literature, there are three prevailing theories on why traffic exists: <br><br>

**1. Demand for road usage exceeds capacity** (e.g., more cars on the road during rush hour than a road can handle)

**2. Human driving behavior creates inefficiencies** (e.g., a car that brakes hard will cause all the cars behind it to brake even harder)

**3. Design and construction of roads creates friction in the flow of traffic** (e.g., a traffic light that takes a long time to change)

Majority of the dialogue on traffic focuses on the first two causes, which are difficult to address but easy to observe. The third point is the opposite in nature; addressable via better design but challenging to pinpoint. This third theory is the focus of this analysis.

## How to study traffic

Studying traffic requires a dataset that is difficult to curate: real vehicle data with speed, direction, and location over a significant period of time. While it would be challenging to get this data for personal/civilian cars, there is one type of vehicle that is often tracked publically: **public buses**. <br><br>

The Chicago Transit Authority has an open API which tracks each bus in real time, around the clock. Over the course of a month, I was able to collect 2.6M records of bus locations across 30 days and all 100+ bus routes. The raw data looks like this:

When we visualize a random subset of this data, we can see the distribution of buses across the city:
